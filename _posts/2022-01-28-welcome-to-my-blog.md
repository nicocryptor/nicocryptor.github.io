I plan to create this blog as a way to communicate to the community all the information I learn and generate. **I plan to talk mostly about the following topics:**

* Cybersecurity basics
* Solutions to common and uncommon problems 
* Own configurations on my machines
* Solutions to HackTheBox machines
* Step by step to create a script
* Notes and opinions on related topics
* Working together my way to the union of Cybersecurity, Crypto and Blockchain

> My long term project is to create content and community entirely related to Cybersecurity related to Crypto and Blockchain.

I'm excited about this partly because of this great new technology, but mostly because of the political weapon it signifies.
